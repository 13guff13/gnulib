Gnulib module: ftello

@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
@code{fflush}, @code{ftell}, @code{ftello}, @code{fgetpos} behave incorrectly
on input streams that are opened in @code{O_TEXT} mode and whose contents
contains Unix line terminators (LF), on some platforms: mingw.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{ftell} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use ftello instead.
