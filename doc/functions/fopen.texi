Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set @code{errno}
upon failure.
@item
On Windows, this function returns a file stream in ``text'' mode by default;
this means that it translates @code{'\n'} to CR/LF by default.  Use the
@code{"b"} flag if you need reliable binary I/O.
