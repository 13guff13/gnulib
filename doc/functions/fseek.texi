@node fseek
@section @code{fseek}
@findex fseek

POSIX specification: @url{http://www.opengroup.org/susv3xsh/fseek.html}

Gnulib module: fseeko

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function mistakenly succeeds on non-seekable files: mingw.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set @code{errno}
upon failure.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{fseek} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use fseeko instead.
@end itemize
