POSIX specification: @url{http://www.opengroup.org/susv3xsh/lseek.html}

Gnulib module: lseek

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

This function mistakenly succeeds on pipes on some platforms: mingw, BeOS.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
POSIX does not specify which file descriptors support seeking and which don't.
In practice, regular files and block devices support seeking, and ttys, pipes,
and most character devices don't support it.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{lseek} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use the
@code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
@item
When the third argument is invalid, POSIX says that @code{lseek} should set
@code{errno} to @code{EINVAL} and return -1, but in this situation a
@code{SIGSYS} signal is raised on some platforms:
IRIX 6.5.
