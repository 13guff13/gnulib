Gnulib module: open

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does usually not
recognize the @file{/dev/null} filename.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows, this function returns a file handle in @code{O_TEXT} mode by
default; this means that it translates '\n' to CR/LF by default.  Use the
@code{O_BINARY} flag if you need reliable binary I/O.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{open} may not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use the
@code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
