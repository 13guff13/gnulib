POSIX specification: @url{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/realpath.html}

Gnulib module: ---

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, BeOS.
@item
This function does not allow to determine the required size of output buffer;
PATH_MAX --- if it is defined --- is nothing more than a guess.
@end itemize

Extension: Gnulib provides a module @samp{canonicalize-lgpl} that defines a
function @code{canonicalize_file_name} that is like @code{realpath} but without
size limitations.
