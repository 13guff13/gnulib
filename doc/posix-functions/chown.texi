POSIX specification: @url{http://www.opengroup.org/susv3xsh/chown.html}

Gnulib module: chown

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
When passed an argument of -1, some implementations really set the owner 
user/group id of the file to this value, rather than leaving that id of the
file alone.
@item
When applied to a symbolic link, some implementations don't dereference
the symlink, i.e.@: they behave like @code{lchown}.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw.
@end itemize
