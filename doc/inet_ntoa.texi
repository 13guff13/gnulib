@node inet_ntoa
@section inet_ntoa
@findex inet_ntoa

The @code{inet_ntoa} function need not be reentrant, and consequently
is not required to be thread safe.  Implementations of
@code{inet_ntoa} typically write the time stamp into static buffer.
If two threads call @code{inet_ntoa} at roughly the same time, you
might end up with the wrong date in one of the threads, or some
undefined string.  Further, @code{inet_ntoa} is specific for
@acronym{IPv4} addresses.

A protocol independent function is @code{inet_ntop}.
