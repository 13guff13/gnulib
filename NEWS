Date        Modules         Changes

2007-12-03  getpagesize     The include file is changed from "getpagesize.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

2007-12-03  strcase         The include file is changed from <string.h> to
                            <strings.h>.

2007-10-07  most modules    The license for most modules has changed from
                            GPLv2+ to GPLv3+, and from LGPLv2+ to LGPLv3+.
                            A few modules are still under LGPLv2+; see the
                            module description for the applicable license.

2007-09-01  linebreak       "linebreak.h" no longer declares the functions
                            locale_charset, uc_width, u{8,16,32}_width. Use
                            "uniwidth.h" to get these functions declared.

2007-08-28  areadlink-with-size
                            Renamed from mreadlink-with-size.
                            Function renamed: mreadlink_with_size ->
                            areadlink_with_size.

2007-08-22  getdelim, getline
                            The include file is changed from "getdelim.h"
                            and "getline.h" to the POSIX 200x <stdio.h>.

2007-08-18  idcache         Now provides prototypes in "idcache.h".

2007-08-10  xstrtol         The STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR macro is removed.
                            Use the new xstrtol_fatal function instead.

2007-08-04  human           The function human_options no longer reports an
                            error to standard error; that is now the
                            caller's responsibility.  It returns an
                            error code of type enum strtol_error
                            instead of the integer option value, and stores
                            the option value via a new int * argument.
            xstrtol         The first two arguments of STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR
                            are now an option name and option argument
                            instead of an option argument and a type string,
                            STRTOL_FAIL_WARN is removed.

2007-07-14  gpl, lgpl       New Texinfo versions with no sectioning commands.

2007-07-10  version-etc     Output now mentions GPLv3+, not GPLv2+.  Use
                            gnulib-tool --local-dir to override this.

2007-07-07  wcwidth         The include file is changed from "wcwidth.h" to
                            <wchar.h>.

2007-07-02  gpl, lgpl       Renamed to gpl-2.0 and lgpl-2.1 respectively.
                            (There is also a new module gpl-3.0.)

2007-06-16  lchown          The include file is changed from "lchown.h" to
                            <unistd.h>.

2007-06-09  xallocsa        Renamed to xmalloca. The include file "xallocsa.h"
                            was remamed to "xmalloca.h". The function was
                            renamed:
                              xallocsa -> xmalloca

2007-06-09  allocsa         Renamed to malloca. The include file "allocsa.h"
                            was remamed to "malloca.h". The function-like
                            macros were renamed:
                              allocsa -> malloca
                              freesa -> freea

2007-05-20  utimens         Renamed futimens to gl_futimens, to avoid
                            conflict with the glibc-2.6-introduced function
                            that has a different signature.

2007-05-01  sigprocmask     The module now depends on signal, so replace
                              #include "sigprocmask.h"
                            with
                              #include <signal.h>

2007-04-06  gettext         The macro HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE is no longer set.
                            You can replace all its uses with 1, i.e. assume
                            'long double' as a type exists.

2007-04-01  arcfour         Renamed to crypto/arcfour.

2007-03-27  vasprintf       The module now depends on stdio, so replace
                               #include "vasprintf.h"
                            with

2007-03-19  iconvme         The module is removed. Use module striconv instead:
                            iconv_string -> str_iconv
                            iconv_alloc -> str_cd_iconv (with reversed
                                           arguments)

2007-03-15  list            The functions gl_list_create_empty and
            array-list      gl_list_create now take an extra fourth argument.
            carray-list     You can pass NULL.

            array-oset      third argument. You can pass NULL.
            avltree-oset
            rbtree-oset

2007-03-12  des             The types and functions in lib/des.h have been
            gc-des          renamed:

                            des_ctx -> gl_des_ctx, tripledes_ctx -> gl_3des_ctx,
                            des_is_weak_key -> gl_des_is_weak_key,
                            des_setkey -> gl_des_setkey,
                            des_makekey -> gl_des_makekey,
                            des_ecb_crypt -> gl_des_ecb_crypt,
                            des_ecb_encrypt -> gl_des_ecb_encrypt,
                            des_ecb_decrypt -> gl_des_ecb_decrypt,

                            tripledes_set3keys -> gl_3des_set3keys,
                            tripledes_makekey -> gl_3des_makekey,
                            tripledes_ecb_crypt -> gl_3des_ecb_crypt.

                            Also consider using the "gc-des" buffer instead of
                            using the "des" module directly.

2007-02-28  xreadlink       The module xreadlink was renamed to
                            xreadlink-with-size. The function was renamed:
                            xreadlink -> xreadlink_with_size.

2007-02-18  exit            The modules now depend on stdlib, so replace

            mkstemp           #include "mkdtemp.h"
                              #include "mkstemp.h"
                            with
                              #include <stdlib.h>

2007-01-26  strdup          The module now depends on string, so replace
                              #include "strdup.h"
                            with
                              #include <string.h>

# This is for Emacs.
