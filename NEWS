Date        Modules         Changes

2007-05-20  utimens         Renamed futimens to gl_futimens, to avoid
                            conflict with the glibc-2.6-introduced function
                            that has a different signature.

2007-05-01  sigprocmask     The module now depends on signal, so replace
                              #include "sigprocmask.h"
                            with
                              #include <signal.h>

2007-04-06  gettext         The macro HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE is no longer set.
                            You can replace all its uses with 1, i.e. assume
                            'long double' as a type exists.

2007-03-27  vasprintf       The module now depends on stdio, so replace
                               #include "vasprintf.h"
                            with

2007-03-19  iconvme         The module is removed. Use module striconv instead:
                            iconv_string -> str_iconv
                            iconv_alloc -> str_cd_iconv (with reversed
                                           arguments)

2007-03-15  list            The functions gl_list_create_empty and
            array-list      gl_list_create now take an extra fourth argument.
            carray-list     You can pass NULL.
            linked-list
            linkedhash-list
            avltree-list
            rbtree-list

            rbtreehash-list

2007-03-15  oset            The function gl_oset_create_empty now takes a
            array-oset      third argument. You can pass NULL.
            avltree-oset
            rbtree-oset

2007-03-12  des             The types and functions in lib/des.h have been
            gc-des          renamed:

                            des_ctx -> gl_des_ctx, tripledes_ctx -> gl_3des_ctx,
                            des_is_weak_key -> gl_des_is_weak_key,
                            des_setkey -> gl_des_setkey,
                            des_makekey -> gl_des_makekey,
                            des_ecb_crypt -> gl_des_ecb_crypt,
                            des_ecb_encrypt -> gl_des_ecb_encrypt,
                            des_ecb_decrypt -> gl_des_ecb_decrypt,
                            tripledes_set2keys -> gl_3des_set2keys,
                            tripledes_set3keys -> gl_3des_set3keys,
                            tripledes_makekey -> gl_3des_makekey,
                            tripledes_ecb_crypt -> gl_3des_ecb_crypt.

                            Also consider using the "gc-des" buffer instead of
                            using the "des" module directly.

2007-02-28  xreadlink       The module xreadlink was renamed to
                            xreadlink-with-size. The function was renamed:
                            xreadlink -> xreadlink_with_size.

2007-02-18  exit            The modules now depend on stdlib, so replace
            mkdtemp           #include "exit.h"
            mkstemp           #include "mkdtemp.h"
                              #include "mkstemp.h"
                            with
                              #include <stdlib.h>

2007-01-26  strdup          The module now depends on string, so replace
                              #include "strdup.h"
                            with
                              #include <string.h>

# This is for Emacs.
# Local Variables:
