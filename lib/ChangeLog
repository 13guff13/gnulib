	* mountlist.c: Remove anachronistic casts of xmalloc, xrealloc,
	and xcalloc return values.
	(read_filesystem_list) [MOUNTED_GETFSSTAT]:
	Use MNT_NOWAIT, rather than MNT_WAIT.  Otherwise, `df DIR' could
	hang on OSF/1 5.1 for DIR on both local and remote file systems.
	Reported by (and fix confirmed by) Nelson H. F. Beebe.
	(read_filesystem_list) [MOUNTED_VMOUNT]: Detect any
	error from mntctl.
	Use mntctl's return value to drive the entry-processing loop, since
	we can't rely on the value of the vmt_length member in the last
	entry.  On some systems doing so could result in exhausting
	virtual memory.  Based in part on a patch from Mike Jetzer.

2003-08-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merges from coreutils, plus other fixes.

	(vasnprintf): Use it instead of wcslen.

2003-08-11  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* stdbool_.h (_Bool): Undo last change; instead use a negative enum
	value to ensure that _Bool promotes to int. Use #define for _Bool when
	using the Solaris C compiler. Adds comments suggested by Paul Eggert.

2003-08-10  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	* regex.h: update from libc (whitespace fix).

2003-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge some files from coreutils.  These changes were
	originally made by Jim Meyering.
	* lib/acl.c: Include <sys/types.h> before <sys/stat.h>;
	many older Unixes require this.
	* lib/alloca.c (alloca): Remove cast to argument of free;
	no longer needed in C89.
	* lib/alloca_.h, lib/regex.h: Fix white space to match
	what GNU indent does.

2003-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* bumpalloc.h: Remove.

2003-08-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* getloadavg.c: Change copyright notice and spacing to conform to
	GNU coding style.

	Merge from coreutils.

	ymp-cray-unicos9.0.2.X.
	Combine two mostly-identical uses of alloca into one.
	Thanks to the Cray-Cyber project for access to a Cray Y-MP.

2003-08-04  Dave Love <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	[From Emacs.]

	* getloadavg.c: Check `__unix' as well as `unix'.  Use #ifdef, not
	#if.  Check HAVE_LIBKSTAT as well as LOAD_AVE_TYPE.  Check

	obsolete NLIST_NAME_UNION.
	[__GNU__]: Undef BSD and FSCALE.
	[!NLIST_STRUCT]: Remove conditional definition of NLIST_STRUCT.

2003-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* stdbool_.h (_Bool): Make it signed char, instead of
	an enum type, so that it's guaranteed to promote to int.  See:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2003-07/msg00124.html>

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* strerror.c: Include config.h, limits.h.  Declare sprintf.

2003-07-24  Derek Robert Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>
	    Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* getline.h (getline, getdelim): Change return type to ssize_t.
	* getline.c (getline, getdelim): Likewise.

	m4/getline.m4.

2003-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xalloc.h (XCALLOC, XREALLOC, CCLONE): Fix under- and

	Sync with coreutils.

	* xalloc.h (XMALLOC, XCALLOC, XREALLOC): Remove casts not

	* xmemcoll.c: Likewise.  Include exitfail.h.
	(xmemcoll): Use exit_failure instead of xalloc_exit_failure.

2003-07-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* closeout.h (close_stdout_set_status, close_stdout_status): Remove.
	* closeout.c: Likewise.  Include "closeout.h" right after config.h,
	to test that it can stand by itself.  Include "exitfail.h".
	Clients should set exit_failure instead.
	(EXIT_FAILURE): Remove; no longer needed.  Do not include <stdlib.h>.

2003-07-18  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	ref-del.sin, setenv.c, unsetenv.c, vasnprintf.c, vasnprintf.h,
	vasprintf.c, vasprintf.h: Regenerate.  These files are now being
	updated automatically by ../config/srclist-update.  This changes
	their license from LPGL to GPL.

2003-07-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't emit diagnostics.  Let callers do that.
	* save-cwd.c: Don't include "error.h".
	(save_cwd): Don't call error.  Ensure that errno is valid
	when returning nonzero.

	* save-cwd.h (restore_cwd): Update prototype.
	* save-cwd.c (restore_cwd): Remove two parameters.
	Simplify.  Don't call error upon failure.  Let callers do that.
	(save_cwd): Mention that Irix 5.3 has the same problem as SunOS 4
	when auditing is enabled.  But don't bother updating the #if.

2003-07-14  Simon Josefsson  <jas@extundo.com>

	* mempcpy.h: New file.
	* mempcpy.c: New file.

2003-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* ceill.c, expl.c, floorl.c, frexpl.c, ldexpl.c, mathl.h,
	sincosl.c, sqrtl.c, trigl.c, trigl.h, poll.c, poll_.h, mkstemp.c,
	unicodeio.c, unicodeio.h, unlocked-io.h:
	Switch from LGPL to GPL.

2003-07-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* obstack.h (__INT_TO_PTR): Revert change of 2003-03-13;
	it breaks C++ compilation.
	[!__GNUC__ || !__STDC__] (obstack_finish): Cast result to void*.

2003-07-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* vasnprintf.c: Remove trailing blanks.
	Make cpp indentation consistent.

2003-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* alloca_.h, euidaccess.c, getpass.c, memrchr.c, obstack.h,
	posixver.c, strftime.c, strnlen.c, strverscmp.c:
	Switch from LGPL to GPL.

2003-07-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* mktime.c: Fix some boundary cases and remove need for floating point.

	Issue a compile-time diagnostic if time_t is floating point, or if
	two's complement arithmetic is not in effect, or if arithmetic
	right shift does not propagate the sign.  These assumptions were
	all in the original code but they weren't checked.

	(TIME_T_MIDPOINT, verify): New macros.
	(__isleap): Remove; it has integer overflow problems.
	(leapyear): New function, without those problems.
	(ydhms_tm_diff): Remove; splitting into two parts.
	(ydhms_diff): New function, containing the arithmetic part of
	the old ydhms_tm_diff function.  Issue a compile-time
	diagnostic if we are not using C99 integer division.
	Avoid casts when possible.
	(guess_time_tm): New function, containing the checking part of
	the old ydhms_tm_diff function.  Return the new value, rather than
	the difference between it and the old.  Accept a new argument T
	so that *T specifies the old value.  Check for overflow in the result.

	(__mktime_internal): Use a time_t offset, not a long int offset.
	This undoes the 2003-06-04 change, which is no longer needed now
	that we have better overflow checking.
	(localtime_offset): Likewise.

	(__mktime_internal): Avoid harmful overflow on hosts where time_t
	and long are 64-bit but int is only 32-bit.
	(ydhms_diff): Use long int to store year1 and yday1.
	Issue a compile-time diagnostic if long int is not wide enough.

	(__mktime_internal): Use long int to store adjusted year and yday.
	Use plain C rather than preprocessor commands, if that doesn't
	affect efficiency.
	Check for overflow (and try to repair) after each probe
	rather than checking only at the very end.  This avoids some bugs
	(e.g., southern hemisphere, behind GMT, and GMT offset at minimum time
	does not equal GMT offset at maximum time).
	Use integer to check for overflow rather than floating point; this
	is more portable to non-IEEE hosts, and is a tad faster.
	When we detect that we are oscillating between two values,
	don't check whether tm_isdst has the requested value, since
	we already know the answer.  When tm_isdst has the wrong value,
	use a different heuristic to find the right one, based on the
	extreme values actually observed in practice in tz2003a,
	rather than the (overly optimistic) "previous 3 calendar quarters".

	(not_equal_tm, print_tm, check_result): Use "const T" rather than
	"T const" to accommodate glibc style.
	(check_result): Use less-confusing report format.  "long" -> "long int.
	(main): Likewise.
	Don't loop if the iteration overflows time_t.
	Allow a negative step in the iteration.

2003-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xreadlink.c: Include <sys/types.h> unconditionally, instead of
	having it depend on HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H.

	* readlink.c: New file.

2003-06-20  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* unicodeio.h (PARAMS): Remove.
	* unicodeio.c: Don't use PARAMS.

2003-06-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Merge changes from coreutils.

	unistd-safer.h, version-etc.h, xalloc.h, xreadlink.h, xstrtod.h,
	xstrtol.h: Likewise.
	* filemode.h, hard-locale.h, memcoll.h, modechange.h, physmem.h,
	same.h, strverscmp.h: Do not include config.h; no longer needed.
	Anyway, config.h should always be included before any other file.

2003-06-11  Simon Josefsson  <jas@extundo.com>

	* sysexit_.h: New file.

2003-05-20  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	Merge from coreutils.
	* same.c: (same_name): Declare *_basename locals to be `const'.
	Consolidate declarations and initializations of *_base* locals.

	Merge from coreutils.

	(unsetenv): New static function, from GNU libc.
	(rpl_putenv): Use it.

	* modechange.c: Remove trailing blanks.

	Merge from coreutils.
	* fsusage.c: Remove declaration of statfs.
	It conflicted with one from OSF/1 5.1 in <sys/mount.h>.

	* posixtm.c: Include <stdbool.h> unconditionally.

2003-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* mktime.c (__mktime_internal): When resolving a tm_isdst
	mismatch, look in future quarters as well as past.  This fixes a
	bug when processing fall-backwards gaps immediately after a long
	period of daylight-saving time.

	* mktime.c: Assume freestanding C89 or better.
	(HAVE_LIMITS_H): Remove.  Assume it's 1.
	(__P): Remove; not used.
	(CHAR_BIT, INT_MIN, INT_MAX): Remove; <limits.h> defines them.
	(mktime, not_equal_tm, print_tm, check_result,
	main): Use prototypes.  Use const * where appropriate.
	(main): Fix typo in testing code that uncovered by above changes.
	(Local Variables): Remove -DHAVE_LIMITS_H from compile-command.

2003-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* mktime.c: Fix Debian bug 177940
	<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=177940>.
	(localtime_offset): Now long int, not time_t, because we want it
	to be guaranteed to be signed.  All uses changed.
	(__mktime_internal): If overflow would occur when adding offset,
	don't add it.

	Merge 'human' changes from coreutils.  Rewrite to support
	locale-specific notations like thousands separators.
	* human.c: Simplify authorship notice.
	Include human.h immediately after config.h.
	<sys/types.h>, <stdio.h>: Do not include; no longer needed.
	<limits.h>: Do not include, since human.h does.
	(SIZE_MAX, UINTMAX_MAX): New macros.
	<strings.h>: Include if HAVE_STRINGS_H, not if !HAVE_STRING_H.
	<locale.h>: Include if HAVE_LOCALE_H and HAVE_LOCALECONV.
	(HUMAN_READABLE_SUFFIX_LENGTH_MAX): New macro.
	(power_letter): Renamed from suffixes.

	Put the options before the sizes in the arg list.
	Support all the new options.
	The old human_readable function has been removed;
	use inttostr.h instead.
	(human_readable, default_block_size, humblock):
	Use uintmax_t, not int, for block sizes.
	(human_readable_inexact, block_size_types): Remove.
	(block_size_opts): New constant.
	(human_options): Renamed from human_block_size, with new signature
	that allows block sizes up to UINTMAX_MAX.  All callers changed.
	* human.h: Add copyright and authorship notice.

	(human_readable_inexact, human_block_size): Remove.
	(human_readable): Size args are now uintmax_t, not int.
	(human_options): New decl.

	* exclude.c: (new_exclude, add_exclude): Remove casts that are
	unnecessary now that we assume C89 or better.  This change
	imported from coreutils.

	* mktime.c (__mktime_internal): Do not reject negative timestamps
	arbitrarily.  This is the same patch as 2003-05-28, but it got lost
	in the 2003-05-30 sync from glibc.

	.h files should stand alone, but we shouldn't include <sys/types.h>
	if we can get away with just <stddef.h>.

	* __fpending.h, addext.c, backupfile.c, exclude.c, getline.c,
	malloc.c, putenv.c, realloc.c, strcasecmp.c: Include <stddef.h>
	rather than <sys/types.h>, as we merely need size_t.
	* dirname.h, memcoll.h, xalloc.h, xmemcoll.h: Include <stddef.h>,
	to get size_t.
	* hash.h, linebuffer.h, readtokens.h, stdio-safer.h, version-etc.h:
	Include <stdio.h>, to get FILE.
	* memcasecmp.c: Don't include <sys/types.h>, as we can assume
	memcasecmp.h has included <stddef.h> and all we need is size_t.
	* memcoll.c: Include "memcoll.h", which gets us size_t and checks
	our interface, instead of including <sys/types.h>

2003-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	[from coreutils]
	Fix some minor time-related bugs with POSIX time arguments.
	Some valid time stamps were being rejected (notably -1, and
	time stamps before 1900 on 64-bit hosts).  And some invalid
	time stamps were being accepted, e.g. September 31.

	* posixtm.h (posixtime): Return bool instead of time_t, so
	that we can return (time_t) -1 successfully.
	* posixtm.c: Likewise.
	[HAVE_STDBOOL_H]: Include <stdbool.h>.

2002-11-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* hash.c: Avoid use of <assert.h>, as the GNU Coding Standards
	hint that one should use `if (! x) abort ();' rather than `assert
	(x);', and anyway it's one less thing to worry about configuring.
	(hash_lookup, hash_get_first, hash_get_next, hash_find_entry,
	hash_rehash, hash_insert): Use abort rather than assert.

2002-11-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* quotearg.h: Allow multiple inclusion by surrounding with

	ones.  At least on GNU/Linux systems, `auto' means something else.
	From Michael Stone.

2002-11-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge argmatch cleanups from Bison.  Assume C89.

	* argmatch.c: Include config.h here, not in argmatch.h.

	Always include <string.h>, since we assume C89.
	(EXIT_FAILURE): Remove pre-C89 bug workaround.

2002-06-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* fnmatch.c, fnmatch_loop.c (WIDE_CHAR_SUPPORT):
	New macro.  Use it uniformly instead of

	2.2.  This should be safe, since POSIX requires S_ISREG and
	Unix Version 7 had S_IFREG.  We don't need to check for
	<sys/types.h> since we don't use any symbols that it defines.

2002-06-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* file-type.h (FILE_TYPE_H): Guard entire contents with #ifndef.
	For GNU libc 2.2 and newer, ensure that <sys/types.h> and <sys/stat.h>

2002-05-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Fix a problem seen only on nonconforming systems whereby ls.c's
	use of localtime, and then of gettimeofday would cause trouble:
	the localtime call used to initialize rpl_gettimeofday's save
	mechanism would clobber ls's current local time information so
	that in any long listing the first file would always be listed
	with date 1970-01-01.  Analysis by Volker Borchert.

	* sig2str.h (SIGNUM_BOUND): Do not use WTERMSIG, to avoid
	depending on <sys/wait.h> and WTERMSIG.  Default to 64 instead
	of 127, since 64 is the largest conceivable number for ancient
	nonstandard hosts.
	* sig2str.c: Do not include <sys/wait.h>; no longer needed.

2002-04-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* sig2str.c (WTERMSIG): Remove definition (unused).

2002-04-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

2002-03-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* gettime.c (gettime): Test HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME,

	cause trouble.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2002-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* path-concat.c (xpath_concat): Reorder code to pacify

2002-01-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tempname.c: Merge with version from libc.
	* regex.c: Likewise.

	* tempname.c: Include stdlib.h unconditionally.  On some old systems
	for which STDC_HEADERS is 0, it was not included, resulting in a

	* tempname.c (TMP_MAX): Remove; no longer needed.
	(TEMPORARIES): New macro.
	(__gen_tempname): Use TEMPORARIES rather than TMP_MAX.  This

	TMP_MAX is 17576).

2001-11-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tempname.c [!HAVE_DECL_GETENV]: Declare getenv to avoid warning
	on SunOS 4.

2001-11-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* modechange.c (mode_adjust): Fix error introduced on 1999-04-26
	that made e.g., `chmod a=,o=w,g=o F' cause F to be group readable
	rather than group writable.  Patch by Juan F. Codagnone.

	* readtokens.c: Remove explicit declarations of xmalloc and xrealloc,
	Instead, include "xalloc.h".

	* mountlist.c: Include unlocked-io.h after all system headers.

	* physmem.c [HAVE_SYS_PSTAT_H]: Include <sys/pstat.h>.
	(physmem_total) [HAVE_PSTAT_GETSTATIC]: If sysconf couldn't be used to
	determine the amount of total physical memory, use pstat_getstatic.
	HPUX-11 doesn't define _SC_PHYS_PAGES.
	(physmem_available) [HAVE_PSTAT_GETSTATIC && HAVE_PSTAT_GETDYNAMIC]:
	If sysconf couldn't be used to determine the amount of available
	physical memory, use both pstat_getstatic and pstat_getdynamic.
	Based on a patch from Bob Proulx.

2001-11-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* xstat.in (slash_aware_lstat): Correct a misleading comment.

	* argmatch.h (ARGMATCH_TO_ARGUMENT): Remove casts of first two args
	in argmatch_to_argument call.

	* dirfd.c (dirfd): Reflect the fact that DIR_TO_FD now takes an

2001-10-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* hard-locale.c (alloca): Define to __builtin_alloca if __GNUC__,
	to avoid a warning if -Wall.

2001-10-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* regex.c (uintptr_t): Remove macro and decl; it's config.h's job.

2001-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* obstack.c (_): Honor the setting of ENABLE_NLS.  Otherwise,
	this code would end up calling gettext even in packages built
	with --disable-nls.

	* regex.c (_): Likewise.

2001-10-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	(error_tail, error, error_at_line): Use it.

2001-10-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* argmatch.c (argmatch_invalid): Use quotearg_n_style (0, ...
	and quote_n (1, ... to avoid clobbering a buffer.

	* Makefile.am: (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add hash-pjw.c and hash-pjw.h.
	* hash-pjw.c: New file (factored out of fileutils' remove.c).

	a boolean context.

2001-09-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix bug reported by Petter Reinholdtsen for HP-UX 10.20, which

	(strtoul): Do not declare if HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL.
	(strtoimax, strtoumax): Do not declare if already defined as a macro.

2001-09-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Most macros in unlocked-io.h had the wrong number of arguments.
	* gen-uio: New script.
	(USE_UNLOCKED_IO): Define to 1 if not already defined.
	* unlocked-io.hin: Remove file.
	* Makefile.am (unlocked-io.h): Rewrite to use a separate script,
	rather than trying to embed it here.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add gen-uio.  Remove unlocked-io.hin
	Reported by Padraig Brady.

2001-09-25  Volker Borchert  <bt@teknon.de>

2001-09-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* xstrtol.c (strtoimax): Guard declaration with
	`#if !HAVE_DECL_STRTOIMAX', rather than just `#ifndef strtoimax'.
	The latter fails because some systems (at least rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.3.0)
	have their own, conflicting declaration of strtoimax in sys/inttypes.h.
	(strtoumax): Likewise, for completeness (it wasn't necessary).

2001-09-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* strtoimax.c (HAVE_LONG_LONG):

	fix the HAVE_GETCWD_NULL code to behave more like the
	!HAVE_GETCWD_NULL code used to.

	Include "xalloc.h".
	(xgetcwd): Do not return NULL when memory is exhausted; instead,
	invoke xalloc_die.

2001-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xreadlink.c (xreadlink): Omit size_t* arg.  All uses changed.
	Use ssize_t, not int, to store result of readlink.
	Check for ssize_t overflow as well as size_t overflow,
	as POSIX says the result of readlink is implementation-defined
	when ssize_t overflows.
	Remove unnecessary cast to char*.
	Use free+malloc instead of realloc, as the storage doesn't need
	to be preserved and it's clearer and can be more efficient that way.
	(SIZE_MAX, SSIZE_MAX): New macros, if <limits.h> doesn't declare.
	* xreadlink.h (xreadlink): Update prototype.

2001-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	like the HAVE_GETCWD_NULL code.
	Include pathmax.h if not HAVE_GETCWD.
	Do not include xalloc.h.
	(INITIAL_BUFFER_SIZE): New symbol.
	Do not use xmalloc / xrealloc, since the caller is responsible for
	handling errors.  Preserve errno around `free' during failure.
	Do not overrun buffer when using getwd.

2001-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xgetcwd.c (xgetcwd): Use HAVE_GETCWD_NULL, not (defined
	__GLIBC__ && __GLIBC__ >= 2), to decide whether to use getcwd (NULL, 0).

2001-09-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* error.c: Update from GNU libc.

2001-09-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	doesn't conflict with sparc Solaris 7's definition in
	/usr/include/sys/int_types.h.

	* exclude.c: Use `""', not `<>' to #include non-system header files.
	(fnmatch_no_wildcards): Rewrite not to use function names, strcasecmp
	and strncasecmp as r-values.  Unixware didn't have declarations.

2001-08-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* xgetcwd.c (xgetcwd): Reorganize to avoid some duplication.
	Use an initial, malloc'd, buffer of length 128 rather than
	a statically allocated one of length 1024.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xgetcwd.c: Don't include pathmax.h.
	Include stdlib.h and unistd.h if available.
	Include xalloc.h.
	(xmalloc, xstrdup, free): Remove decls.
	(xgetcwd): Don't assume sizes fit in unsigned.
	Check for overflow when computing sizes.
	Simplify reallocation code.

2001-08-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Remove strtoxmax.c.

	* strtoimax.c: Renamed from strtoxmax.c, removing the
	old strtoimax.c.

	Also, make the following further changes to make this file's
	configuration more similar to that of strtol.c:

	(strtoumax, uintmax_t, strtoull, strtol): Remove.
	(intmax_t, strtoimax, strtol, strtoll): New macros, if UNSIGNED.

	Fix copyright notice, as 1999 was missing.
	(verify): New macro.
	(strtoimax): Check sizes at compile-time, not run-time.
	Prefer strtol to strtoll if both work.
	(main): Remove; it was not that useful and was a pain to maintain.

	* strtoumax.c: Include strtoimax.c, not strtouxmax.c.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* savedir.c (savedir): Remove size parameter, as POSIX says that
	a directory's st_size can have an arbitrary value, so the old
	usage could waste an arbitrary amount of memory.  All uses
	changed.
	* savedir.h: Update prototype.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* xstrtol.c (strtoimax): New decl.

2001-08-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	LONGINT_INVALID_SUFFIX_CHAR.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	tm to be declared.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* hash.c: Remove '2001' from copyright notice.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* full-write.h: New file.
	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add full-write.h.
	* full-write.c: Correct credits, as cccp.c no longer
	exists and anyway it was so heavily changed from the old cccp
	code as to be unrecognizable.  Include full-write.h.
	(full_write) Return size_t, with short writes meaning failure.
	All callers changed.  This fixes a bug with large buffers
	on 64-bit hosts.
	* utime.c: Include full-write.h.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge 'exclude' changes from tar 1.13.22.
	This fixes one or two unlikely storage allocation overflow bugs,
	but doesn't change user-visible behavior otherwise.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* exclude.c (bool): Declare, perhaps by including stdbool.h.
	(<sys/types.h>): Include only if HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H.

	Include	if available.
	(<xalloc.h>): Include
	(SIZE_MAX): Define if <stdint.h> or <inttypes.h> doesn't.
	(verify): New macro.  Use it to verify that EXCLUDE macros do not
	collide with FNM macros.
	(struct patopts): New struct.
	(struct exclude): Use it, as exclude patterns now come with options.
	(new_exclude): Support above changes.
	(new_exclude, add_exclude_file):
	Initial size must now be a power of two to simplify overflow checking.
	(free_exclude, fnmatch_no_wildcards): New function.
	(excluded_filename): No longer requires options arg, as the options
	are determined by add_exclude.  Now returns bool, not int.
	(excluded_filename, add_exclude):
	Add support for the fancy new exclusion options.
	(add_exclude, add_exclude_file): Now takes int options arg.
	Check for arithmetic overflow when computing sizes.
	(add_exclude_file): xrealloc might modify errno, so don't
	realloc until after errno might be used.

	* exclude.h (EXCLUDE_ANCHORED, EXCLUDE_INCLUDE,EXCLUDE_WILDCARDS):
	New macros.
	(free_exclude): New decl.
	(add_exclude, add_exclude_file): Now takes int options arg.
	(excluded_filename): No longer requires options arg, as the options
	are determined by add_exclude.  Now returns bool, not int.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* alloca.c (alloca): Arg is of type size_t, not unsigned.

2001-08-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add strtoxmax.c

2001-08-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* version-etc.c (version_etc_copyright_fmt): Replace literal year
	of copyright with `%s' so translators don't get an untranslated
	message in 2002.

	(version_etc): Use fprintf rather than fputs.
	Suggestion from Ulrich Drepper.

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add xstrtoimax.c.

	* strtoll.c: New file, from GNU libc.
	* xstrtoimax.c: New file.

	* xstrtol.h: Add xstrtoimax.
	* strtoumax.c: New file.  Simply include "strtoumax.c".
	* strtoimax.c: New file.  Likewise, but first define STRTOUXMAX_SIGNED.

	* strtoumax.c: Factor to work both for unsigned and signed types, ...
	* strtoxmax.c: ... then renamed to this.

2001-08-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.am (unlocked-io.h): Do not append "_unlocked" twice.
	Port to Solaris 8, where 'sed' requires a space after the 'r'
	command, and where sh dislikes "$/".  Clean up the spacing a bit.
	Redirect output to $tmp just once.

2001-08-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@sic.twinsun.com>

	* addext.c (<errno.h>): Include.
	(errno): Declare if not defined.
	(addext): Work correctly when pathconf returns -1 and leaves
	errno alone because there is no limit.  Also, work even if
	pathconf returns a value greater than SIZE_MAX.

2001-08-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* xgetcwd.c (xgetcwd) [defined __GLIBC__ && __GLIBC__ >= 2]:

	(emacs_strftimeu): Renamed from emacs_strftime,
	with extra ut argument.

2001-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	dirname code cleanup.  base_name now behaves more compatibly
	with POSIX basename when given file names that have trailing
	slashes, and similarly for dir_name.  Add new primitives
	base_len and dir_len.  Put the directory-name-related decls
	into dirname.h.

	* addext.c (ISSLASH, base_name): Remove; now in dirname.h.
	* backupfile.c (base_name): Likewise.

	max_backup_version): Use base_len instead of rolling it ourselves.
	Handle the case of "" and (on DOS) "C:" correctly.

	* basename.c: Do not include <stdio.h>, <assert.h>; no longer needed.
	Include <string.h>, <dirname.h>.
	(base_name): Allow file names ending in slashes, other than names
	that are all slashes.  In this case, return the basename followed
	by the slashes.  This is more general, and can be used in places
	where the original base_name purposely had an assertion failure.
	(base_len): New function.

	* dirname.c: Include <string.h> instead of <stdlib.h>.
	Do not include <assert.h>; no longer needed.
	Include xalloc.h.

2000-12-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* modechange.c: Do not assume that mode_t uses the
	traditional octal encoding.  E.g. "chmod 1 FOO" should set
	the other-execute bit of FOO even if S_IXOTH != 1.

	(mode_compile):
	No need to use uintmax_t; unsigned long is long enough.

2000-10-31  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

2000-11-17  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* obstack.h: Formatting changes.

	prevent type checking.

2000-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* quotearg.c:
	Include <wchar.h> even if ! (HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX),
	so that mbstate_t is always defined.

	Do not inspect MB_LEN_MAX, since it's incorrectly defined to
	be 1 in at least one GCC installation, and this configuration
	error is likely to be common.  Ignoring MB_LEN_MAX hurts
	performance on hosts that have mbrtowc but have only unibyte
	locales, but I assume these hosts are rare.

2000-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* quotearg.c: Streamline by invoking multibyte code only if needed.
	<wchar.h>: Include only if HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX.

2000-07-16  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

	* mbswidth.h: New file.
	* mbswidth.c: New file.
	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add mbswidth.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add mbswidth.h.

2000-07-17  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

	Use defined mbstate_t, not HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT,
	to decide whether to define the BeOS workaround macro;
	this adjusts to the change to AC_MBSTATE_T.

2000-07-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* quotearg.h (enum quoting style): New enum clocale_quoting_style.

	* quotearg.c (quoting_style_args, quoting_style_vals,
	quotearg_buffer_restyled): Add support for
	clocale_quoting_style.  Undo previous change to
	locale_quoting_style behavior, and undo the "{LEFT QUOTATION MARK}"
	and "{RIGHT QUOTATION MARK}" msgids.

2000-07-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	The old behavior of quoting `like this' doesn't look good with
	newer, ISO-style fonts.  See:
	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html

	Instead, quote "like this" by default.  Let the translator
	tailor the locale-specific quoting behavior by providing
	translations for {LEFT QUOTATION MARK} and {RIGHT QUOTATION MARK}.

	* quotearg.c (N_): New macro.
	(gettext_default): New function.

	by allocating a larger buffer. Test the gethostname return value for
	being >= 0, not == 0, for BeOS.  Don't exhaust memory if gethostname
	returns an error and ENAMETOOLONG isn't defined.

2000-07-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>
	and Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

2000-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* quotearg.c (mbstate_t): Don't define here.

2000-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* nanosleep.c (SIGCONT): Define if not already defined.

2000-06-17  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

	* mountlist.c: Use MOUNTED_FS_STAT_DEV instead of MOUNTED_NEXT_DEV,
	per change in ../m4/ls-mntd-fs.m4.
	(read_filesystem_list): Ignore symbolic links.

	(savedir): Use xmalloc / xrealloc to allocate memory.
	Use NAME_SIZE_DEFAULT if name_size is negative or overflows to zero.
	Skip "" directory entries.
	Use strlen to calculate directory entry length, since the old method
	is rarely used these days and isn't worth supporting.
	Don't use a pointer after freeing it.
	Check for integer overflow when calculating allocation size.
	Use memcpy to copy entries, instead of stpcpy.
	Set errno properly when returning NULL.
	Check for readdir error.

2000-06-17  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

	* xgetcwd.c (xgetcwd): If the required pathname length is smaller
	than 1024, return a memory chunk of least possible size, instead

2000-02-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* quotearg.c (ALERT_CHAR): New macro.
	(quotearg_buffer_restyled): Use it.

2000-02-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* strtoumax.c: Fix typo in decl of strtoul: s/long long/long/.
	Guard declaration of strtoull also with `&& HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG'.

	* backupfile.c: Guard inclusion of stdlib.h with `#if HAVE_STDLIB_H',
	not `#if STDC_HEADERS'.
	Declare malloc if needed.

	* backupfile.c: Use `#if !HAVE_DECL...' instead of `#ifndef HAVE_DECL..'
	now that autoconf always defines the HAVE_DECL_ symbols.
	* human.c: Likewise.
	* same.c: Likewise.
	* strtoumax.c: Likewise.

	* backupfile.c: Arrange for cpp to fail if the configure-time
	declaration check was not run.
	* hash.c: Likewise.
	* human.c: Likewise.
	* same.c: Likewise.
	* strtoumax.c: Likewise.

	* userspec.c (parse_user_spec): If there is no `:' but there is a `.',
	then first look up the entire `.'-containing string as a login name.

2000-02-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* getdate.y: Handle two-digit years with leading zeros correctly.
	(textint): New typedef.
	(parser_control): Member year changed from int to textint.
	All uses changed.
	(YYSTYPE): Removed; replaced by %union with int and textint members.
	(tDAY, tDAY_UNIT, tDAYZONE, tHOUR_UNIT, tID, tLOCAL_ZONE, tMERIDIAN,
	tMINUTE_UNIT, tMONTH, tMONTH_UNIT tSEC_UNIT, tSNUMBER, tUNUMBER,
	tYEAR_UNIT, tZONE, o_merid): Now of type <intval>.
	(tSNUMBER, tUNUMBER): Now of type <textintval>.
	(date, number, to_year): Use width of number in digits, not its value,
	to determine whether it's a 2-digit year, or a 2-digit time.
	(yylex): Store number of digits of numeric tokens.
	Reported by John Kendall.

	(parser_control): Changed from struct parser_control to typedef (for
	consistency).  All uses changed.

	(tID): Removed; not used.
	(yylex): Return '?' for unknown identifiers, rather than (unused) tID.

2000-02-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* getpagesize.h (getpagesize): Port to VMS for Alpha;
	adapted from changes to grep getpagesize.h by Martin P.J. Zinser.

2000-02-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* userspec.c (ISDIGIT): Define it.
	(isdigit): Remove definition.
	(is_number): Use ISDIGIT, not isdigit.
	<libintl.h>: Include.
	(_ and N_): Define.
	(parse_user_spec): Mark translatable strings.

2000-02-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	With these changes, nanosleep.[ch] are finally enough like the other
	lib/* replacement files to compile on a few more losing systems.

	* nanosleep.h: Don't include config.h.
	Remove prototype from declaration of nanosleep.
	(PARAMS): Remove now-unneeded definition.
	* nanosleep.c: #undef nanosleep.
	(rpl_nanosleep): Rename from nanosleep.

2000-02-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.c (read_utmp): Guard with `#ifdef UTMP_NAME_FUNCTION',
	rather than with `#if HAVE_UTMPNAME'.

2000-02-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.h (UT_USER): Add parens.  From Andreas Schwab.

2000-01-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* nanosleep.h (nanosleep): Guard declaration with
	`#if ! HAVE_DECL_NANOSLEEP'.
	Without this, OFS gets a redeclaration error for rpl_nanosleep, due to
	the declaration in that vendor's sys/timers.h.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* quotearg.c (ISASCII): Add #undef and move definition to follow
	inclusion of wctype.h to work around Solaris 2.6 namespace pollution.
	(ISPRINT): Likewise.
	Reported by Tom Tromey.

2000-01-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.c (extract_trimmed_name): Use UT_USER instead of hard-coding
	uses of ->ut_name.  The latter doesn't work with new Linux header files
	where only utmpx.ut_user is declared.

	* readutmp.h (UT_USER): Define.

2000-01-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Remove explicit mention of
	obstack.c.

2000-01-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* strtoumax.c: [! HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL]: Declare strtoul.
	[! HAVE_DECL_STRTOULL]: Declare strtoull.
	Required for some AIX systems.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.
	[TESTING] (main): New function.

	1997-10-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>
	* dirname.c (dir_name): Support for DOS-style file names with drive
	letters.

	* quotearg.c [HAVE_WCTYPE_H]: Include <wctype.h> for decl of iswprint.

	* strverscmp.c (ISDIGIT): Define.
	(strverscmp): Use ISDIGIT, not isdigit.

2000-01-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* nanosleep.c (nanosleep):
	Don't use SA_INTERRUPT to decide whether to call sigaction, as
	POSIX.1 doesn't require SA_INTERRUPT and some systems
	(e.g. Solaris 7) don't define it.  Use SA_NOCLDSTOP instead;
	it's been part of POSIX.1 since day 1 (in 1988).

2000-01-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* interlock: Remove unused file.  Reported by François Pinard.

2000-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	alert, backslash, formfeed, and vertical tab unnecessarily in
	shell quoting style.
