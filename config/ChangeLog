	* config.sub: update from prep.

2003-07-16    <karl@gnu.org>

	* srclist-update: was running fixlicense twice, which caused
		texinfo.tex to be nullified for some reason.  Simplify,
		$gplsrc is no longer needed as far as I can see?

2003-07-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* srclist.txt: Get the following files from gettext-runtime/intl
	instead: config.charset, localcharset.c, localcharset.h, ref-add.sin,
	ref-del.sin.  From Bruno Haible.
	* srclist-update (fixfile): Change grep pattern again, since the
	previous fix didn't work (there was another trailing $).  Use
	'[$]' to escape the $s.

2003-07-15    <karl@gnu.org>

	* srclist-update (fixfile): Change grep pattern, since 'Id'
	gets expanded when surrounded by '$'.

2003-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* srclist.txt: Add tons more gettext files.  $GETTEXT is now
	assumed to refer to the root of the most recent stable gettext version.
	* srclistvars.sh: Add defaults for eggert.
	* srclist-update: Convert LGPL to GPL in shell scripts, too.
	Match "This program" as well as "The program".  This is needed
	for gettext.

2003-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* srclist.txt: Sort sublists.  Add $LIBCSRC/sysdeps/generic/strtoul.c.
	In comments, add more libc files that differ from gnulib for one
	reason or another; we'd like this list to be smaller but for now
	let's document what we have.

2003-07-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* srclist-update: Port to POSIX 1003.1-2001 hosts by avoiding the
	use of GNU extensions.  Change "x=`eval echo $x`" to the shorter
	and sweeter "eval x=$x".
	* srclist.txt: Get lib/argp* from glibc.

2003-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* srclist.txt ($LIBCSRC/time/mktime.c lib gpl): Comment out for now,
	as glibc mktime is buggy on non-glibc systems.

2002-02-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* config.guess (main): Don't use `head -1'; it's no longer portable.
        Use `sed 1q' instead.
