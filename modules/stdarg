Description:
An <stdarg.h> that conforms to C99.

Files:
m4/stdarg.m4

Depends-on:

configure.ac-early:
dnl Some compilers (e.g., AIX 5.3 cc) need to be in c99 mode
dnl for the builtin va_copy to work.  With Autoconf 2.60 or later,
dnl AC_PROG_CC_STDC arranges for this.  With older Autoconf AC_PROG_CC_STDC
dnl shouldn't hurt, though installers are on their own to set c99 mode.
