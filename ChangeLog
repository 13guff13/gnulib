2001-10-22  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@outpost.dnsalias.org>

	* README: New file
	* doc/*: Add COPYING, COPYING.LIB, COPYING.DOC, fdl.texi
	(per RMS's instructions, this is now the canonical source)
	* lgpl/, gpl/: New directories.

2001-01-24  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* regex.c (mutually_exclusive_p): Don't blindly handle `charset_not'
	as if it was a `charset'.

2000-10-30  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* regex.c (re_iswctype, re_wctype_to_bit): Fix braino.
	(regex_compile): Catch bogus \(\1\).

2000-10-27  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* regex.c (POP_FAILURE_REG_OR_COUNT, re_match_2_internal)
	(re_match_2_internal, re_match_2_internal, re_match_2_internal):
	Giving in to popular pressure to shut up the compiler with casts.

2000-10-25  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* regex.c: More `unsigned char' -> `re_char' changes.
	Also change several `int' into `re_wchar_t'.
	(PATTERN_STACK_EMPTY, PUSH_PATTERN_OP, POP_PATTERN_OP): Remove.
	(PUSH_FAILURE_POINTER): Don't cast any more.
	(POP_FAILURE_REG_OR_COUNT): Remove the cast that strips `const'.
	We want GCC to complain, since this piece of code makes
	re_match non-reentrant, which *should* be fixed.
	(GET_BUFFER_SPACE): Use size_t rather than unsigned long.
	(EXTEND_BUFFER): Use RETALLOC.
	(SET_LIST_BIT): Don't cast.
	(re_wchar_t): New type.
	(re_iswctype, re_wctype_to_bit): Make it crystal clear to GCC
	that those two functions will always properly return.
	(IMMEDIATE_QUIT_CHECK): Cast to void.
	(analyse_first): Use recursion rather than an explicit stack.
	(re_compile_fastmap): Can't fail anymore.
	(re_search_2): Don't check re_compile_fastmap for failure.
	(PUSH_NUMBER): Renamed from PUSH_FAILURE_COUNT.
	Now also sets the new value (passed in a new argument).
	(re_match_2_internal): Use it.
	Also, use a new var `reg' of type size_t when looping through regs
	rather than reuse the inappropriate `mcnt'.

2000-10-24  Andrew Innes  <andrewi@gnu.org>

	* regex.c (IMMEDIATE_QUIT_CHECK): New macro, which does QUIT on
	NT-Emacs only.
	(re_match_2_internal): Use IMMEDIATE_QUIT_CHECK instead of QUIT,
	so that re_search functions only quit when callers expect them to.

2000-10-24  Kenichi Handa  <handa@etl.go.jp>

	* regex.c (regex_compile): Change the way of handling a range from
	a char less than 256 to a char not less than 256.

2000-10-15  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* regex.c (WIDE_CHAR_SUPPORT): Define if _LIBC as well.
